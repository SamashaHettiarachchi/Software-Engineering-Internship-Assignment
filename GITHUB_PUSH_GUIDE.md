## 📝 Steps to Push to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the "+" button (top right) → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `library-management-system` (or your choice)
4. Description: "Library Management System with .NET backend and React frontend"
5. **Keep it PUBLIC** (for internship visibility)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Update Your Git Identity (IMPORTANT!)
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\SE_assignment
git config user.name "Your Real Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3. Connect to GitHub Repository
Replace `yourusername` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub details:
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
```

### 4. Push All Commits to GitHub
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** You'll be prompted for GitHub credentials. Use:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: **Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password)

### 5. Create Personal Access Token (if needed)
If you don't have a token:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name: "Library Management Push"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

## 💡 Tips

- Add a nice description to your repo on GitHub
- Consider adding topics/tags: `react`, `typescript`, `dotnet`, `aspnet-core`, `sqlite`
- Pin this repo to your GitHub profile for visibility

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Error: "remote origin already exists"**
```powershell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

**Error: "Authentication failed"**
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Regenerate a new token if needed

**Want to see your commits locally?**
```powershell
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

**Check total commits:**
```powershell
git rev-list --count HEAD
```

## 🚀 After Pushing
1. Share your GitHub repo link with your internship supervisor
2. Add the repo link to your resume
3. Write a brief project description in your portfolio
4. Take screenshots of the running application
